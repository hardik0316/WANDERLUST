Wanderlust-Project

🚀 Overview
Wanderlust is a full-stack web application built with Node.js, Express, EJS, and MongoDB. It provides an interactive travel platform where users can explore destinations, share travel stories, and plan trips.
This project showcases my skills in full-stack development, routing, templating, data persistence, and deployment readiness.

🛠 Installation & Setup

Install dependencies:

npm install
Create your configuration/environment variables (e.g., MONGO_URI, PORT, SESSION_SECRET).
Create a file like .env (if using dotenv) or edit cloudconfig.js.
Start the development server:

npm start Or if you have a dev script (e.g., using nodemon): npm run dev
